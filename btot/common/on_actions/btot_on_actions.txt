#When adding effects directly in on_actions always consider if it would be best to do so through a scripted effect. on_actions with a lot of script in them are harder to get an overview of.

# country
# root = winning country, from = location
on_siege_won_country = {
	events = {
		btot.1
	}
}

# province
# root = location, from = losing country
on_siege_won_province = {
	events = {
		btot.4
	}
}
